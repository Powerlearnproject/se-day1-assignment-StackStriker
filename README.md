Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems and applications.
The importance of software engineering is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages. There was the development of languages that were the set of instructions that allowed humans to communicate with computers and design software systems and applications.
In 1968, Software engineering was established as a discipline. It was introduced to address the software crisis and ensure that projects were run with efficiency.
Advent of structured programming. After software engineering was established as a system, structured programming came by as it involved the use of clear, logical structures in code and it helped improve code readability, maintainability and reliability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea generation. Involves identification of a gap/problem that you need to solve.
Requirements analysis. This is the identification of what you require duing the development process and what information should you have to solve the problem.
Product design. Know what is the outcome of this product and the relevant output or operation that the system should do with the given input.
Product development. Design the instructions/code to actualize your design.
Intergration & testing. This is checking whether the product is solving the problem or just doing what is required of it when interacted with.
Deployment. The system is now set out for use and interaction with users.
Maintenance. This is the regular development and enhancement of the system and making sure it is up to date and any of the bugs in it are fixed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology deals with a sequential approach with distinct phases of development and it is linear and when deployed, it is rigid and making changes is difficult. An appropriate scenario for use is :Construction projects such as an airport software system, Government or regulatory projects such as a banking software that must comply with strict regulations.
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach and consists of continous cycles of planning, development, testing and feedback and once deployed there is continous changes been made and configurations added. It can be used in Startups & tech companies and E-commerce platforms.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Writes and implements code to build the sotware application.
QA engineer: Tests the software to identify and fix defects, ensuring quality and reliability.
Project manager: Oversees the project, ensuring it stays on schedule, within budget and meets requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs improve te productivity by providing tools like code editors, debuggers and automation features in one platform. An example is Visual studio code (VS code).
VCS - enable the tracking of code changes, collaboration, and rollback of previous versions, preventimg data loss and conflicts. Example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements. Clients often change requirements of product mid-development. Solution: Use the Agile methodology to allow flexibility and iterative development.
2. Keeping up with new technologies. Industry evolves rapidly making it hard to stay updated. Solution: Engage in continous learning through conferences and networking events.
3. Security vulnerability. Software is prone to cyber threats and hacking attempts. Solution: Follow secure coding practies and conduct regular security audits on the system.
4. Poor collaboration and communication. Poor communication among team members leads to misunderstanding. Solution: Use collaboration tools like Github.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing is the test done on individual components or functions of a program in isolation.
It ensures each unit is working correctly before integration into the system.
2. Integration testing. Tests how diferrent components interact.
This detects issues in communication between modules before full system deployment.
3. System testing is a tetst done on the complete software product as a whole.
It ensures the software meets the functional requirements.
4. Acceptance testing is the test conducted by users or clients to verify if the software meets their needs.
This determines if the softwre product is ready for release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the designing of input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and achieve desired output. Its importance is that it improves response accuracy and ensures more accurate and relevant answers.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about computers
Improvement: Explain the evolution of computers from early mechanical computers to modern supercomputers.
The improved prompt is more specific to the evolution of computers, there are clearer expectations, it encourages a well structured answer and avoids ambiguity and broadness.
